<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>

<h3 id="features">I. Features and Functionality</h3>

<ol>
<li>You must not violate any law or the rights of any individual or entity, and must not expose Facebook or Facebook users to harm or legal liability as determined by us in our sole discretion.  In particular you will (if applicable): comply with the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA), and obtain any opt-in consent necessary from users so that user data subject to the VPPA may be shared on Facebook.  You represent that any disclosure to us will not be incidental to the ordinary course of your business.</li>
<li>You must not include functionality that proxies, requests or collects Facebook usernames or passwords.</li>
<li>You must not circumvent (or claim to circumvent) our intended limitations on core Facebook features and functionality.</li>
<li>If you offer a service for a user that integrates user data into a physical product (such as a scrapbook or calendar), you must only create a physical product for that user's personal and non-commercial use.</li>
<li>If you exceed, or plan to exceed, any of the following thresholds please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608171216/https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/?id=206103619499608">contact us</a>  as you may be subject to additional terms: (&gt;5M MAU) or (&gt;100M API calls per day) or (&gt;50M impressions per day).</li>
<li>Your website must offer an explicit "Log Out" option that also logs the user out of Facebook.</li>
<li>Special provision for apps on Pages: When a user visits your Page, if they have not given explicit permission by authorizing your Facebook app or directly providing information to your Page, you may only use information obtained from us and the user's interaction with your Page in connection with that Page. For example, although you may use aggregate analytics for your individual Page, you must not combine information from any other sources to customize the user's experience on your Page and may not use any information about the user's interaction with your Page in any other context (such as analytics or customization across other Pages or websites).  </li>
<li>You must not use or make derivative use of Facebook icons, or use terms for Facebook features and functionality, if such use could confuse users into thinking that the reference is to Facebook features or functionality.</li>
<li>Mobile Web Apps that are running within the Facebook iOS app must not accept payments.  In particular, these apps must not reference, use, or otherwise encourage the use of Facebook Payments or other non-iOS approved payment methods.</li>
<li>Reciprocity and Replicating core functionality: (a) Reciprocity: Facebook Platform enables developers to build personalized, social experiences via the Graph API and related APIs. If you use any Facebook APIs to build personalized or social experiences, you must also enable people to easily share their experiences back with people on Facebook. (b) Replicating core functionality: You may not use Facebook Platform to promote, or to export user data to, a product or service that replicates a core Facebook product or service without our permission.</li>
<li>The primary purpose of your Canvas or Page Tab app on Facebook must not be to simply redirect users out of the Facebook experience and onto an external site.</li>
<li>You must not include data obtained from us in any search engine or directory without our written permission.</li>
<li>Special provisions for games:<br/>
  a. Desktop web games off of <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/">Facebook.com</a> may only use Facebook Login (<a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/">Authentication</a>, excluding user connections such as friend list), <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/">Social Plugins</a> and publishing (e.g., Feed Dialog, Stream Publish, or Open Graph).  When authenticating, these games may not request <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/">additional permissions</a> other than age, email, and our <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/publishing/">Publishing Permissions</a>.<br/>
  b. Games on <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/">Facebook.com</a> and mobile must not share the same app ID with desktop web games off of <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/">Facebook.com</a>.  You must not use <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/#canvas/">Canvas</a> apps to promote or link to game sites off of Facebook, and must not use emails obtained from us to promote or link to desktop web games off of <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/">Facebook.com</a>.<br/>
  c. Games on <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/">Facebook.com</a> or Mobile Web must use Facebook Payments as their sole and exclusive payment method for all virtual goods and currencies made available to users within the game. All other payment options are prohibited within games on <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/">Facebook.com</a> or Mobile Web unless they go through Facebook Payments rather than directly through that payment option. By “Payment Method” we mean any method that allows a user to complete a transaction in a game that is on <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/">Facebook.com</a> or Mobile Web, including, without limitation, by exchanging monetary value for virtual currency or virtual goods, whether directly at the time of purchase or via any previous transaction such as the user's earlier purchase of a prepaid gift card or electronic code. In-game rewards of virtual currency or virtual goods earned by users through game-play activity alone are exempt from this definition.<br/>
  d. Games on <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/">Facebook.com</a> or Mobile Web may reward users with virtual currency or virtual goods in exchange for user actions that do not involve third parties, but rewards for user actions that involve third parties must be powered by Facebook Payments by integrating Facebook Payments offers. For example, you may not reward users with virtual currency or virtual goods in exchange for any action in which personally identifiable information is shared with a third party, you may not reward users with virtual currency or virtual goods in exchange for third party downloads, such as toolbars or ringtones, and you may not reward users with virtual currency for engaging in passive actions offered by third parties, such as watching a video, playing a mini-game, or taking an anonymous poll.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="data">II. Storing and Using Data You Receive From Us</h3>

<ol>
<li>You will only request the data you need to operate your application.</li>
<li>You may cache data you receive through use of the Facebook API in order to improve your application’s user experience, but you should try to keep the data up to date. This permission does not give you any rights to such data.</li>
<li>You will have a privacy policy that tells users what user data you are going to use and how you will use, display, share, or transfer that data.  In addition, you will include your privacy policy URL in the App Dashboard, and must also include a link to your app's privacy policy in any app marketplace that provides you with the functionality to do so.</li>
<li>Until you display a conspicuous link to your privacy policy in your app, any data accessed by your app (including basic account information) may only be used in the context of the user's experience in that app.  A user's friends' data can only be used in the context of the user's experience on your application.</li>
<li>Subject to certain restrictions, including on use and transfer, users give you their <a href="#definitions">basic account information</a> when they connect with your application. For all other data obtained through use of the Facebook API, you must obtain explicit consent from the user who provided the data to us before using it for any purpose other than displaying it back to the user on your application.</li>
<li>You will not directly or indirectly transfer any data you receive from us, including user data or Facebook User IDs, to (or use such data in connection with) any ad network, ad exchange, data broker, or other advertising or monetization related toolset, even if a user consents to such transfer or use. By indirectly we mean you cannot, for example, transfer data to a third party who then transfers the data to an ad network. By any data we mean all data obtained through use of the Facebook Platform (API, Social Plugins, etc.), including aggregate, anonymous or derivative data.</li>
<li>You will not use Facebook User IDs for any purpose outside your application (e.g., your infrastructure, code, or services necessary to build and run your application). Facebook User IDs may be used with external services that you use to build and run your application, such as a web infrastructure service or a distributed computing platform, but only if those services are necessary to running your application and the service has a contractual obligation with you to keep Facebook User IDs confidential.</li>
<li>If you need an anonymous unique identifier to share outside your application with third parties such as content partners, advertisers, or ad networks, you must use our <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user/">mechanism</a>. You must never share this anonymous unique identifier with a data broker, information broker, or any other service that we may define as such under our sole discretion.</li>
<li>You will not sell or purchase any data obtained from us by anyone. If you are acquired by or merge with a third party, you can continue to use user data within your application, but you cannot transfer data outside your application.</li>
<li>If you stop using Platform or we disable your application, you must delete all information about a user you have received from us unless: (a) it is basic account information; or (b) you have received explicit consent from the user to retain their data.</li>
<li>You cannot use a user’s friend list outside of your application, even if a user consents to such use, but you can use connections between users who have both connected to your application.</li>
<li>You will delete all data you receive from us concerning a user if the user asks you to do so, and will provide an easily accessible mechanism for users to make such a request. We may require you to delete data you receive from the Facebook API if you violate our terms.</li>
<li>You will not include data you receive from us concerning a user in any advertising creative, even if a user consents to such use.</li>
<li>You must not give your secret key and access tokens to another party, unless that party is an agent acting on your behalf as an operator of your application. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account identifiers.</li>
</ol>

<li>You must use commercially reasonable geo-filtering technology to block access to your application's content in countries where you are unauthorized to deliver such content, or where delivery of such content would otherwise infringe the rights of a third party.</li>
<li>Although we have no obligation to do so, in our sole discretion we may request, and you are required to provide us, proof that your application and any content of or within your application is properly licensed.</li>
</ol>

<h4>C. Third Party Content</h4>

In other countries, you must comply with local copyright laws and implement an appropriate "notice and takedown" process upon receiving a notice of claimed infringement.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="integration">IV. Application Integration Points</h3>

<ol>
<li>You must not incentivize users to use (or gate content behind the use of) <a href="#Facebook_social_channels" title="Facebook social channels">Facebook social channels</a>, or imply that an incentive is directly tied to the use of our channels.</li>
<li>You must not pre-fill any of the fields associated with the following products, unless the user manually generated the content earlier in the workflow: Stream stories (user_message parameter for Facebook.streamPublish and FB.Connect.streamPublish, and message parameter for stream.publish), Photos (caption), Videos (description), Notes (title and content), Links (comment), and Jabber/XMPP.</li>
<li>If a user grants you a publishing <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/">permission</a>, actions you take on the user's behalf must be expected by the user and consistent with the user's actions within your app.</li>
<li>Platform integrations, including social plugins:<br/>
  a. Your advertisements must not include or be paired with any Platform integrations, including social plugins such as the Like button, without our written permission.<br/>
  b. You must not sell or purchase placement of our <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/">Social Plugins</a>, and must not facilitate or participate in any like exchange program.<br/>

  e. Ad networks, ad exchanges, and data brokers must not use Facebook’s Platform, logos, and trademarks (including, but not limited to, Platform APIs, social plugins, the Share button, and the F logo).  </li>
<li>Facebook messaging (i.e., email sent to an @facebook.com address) is designed for communication between users, and not a channel for applications to communicate directly with users.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608171216/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/concepts/requests/">Requests</a>: you may not offer a select all option or pre-select multiple recipients to receive a Request (effective October 2, 2013).</li>

<p>Developers participating in the program for accepting payments are subject to <a href="/web/20130608171216/http://developers.facebook.com/policy/credits">these terms</a>.</p>

<h3 id="adsapi">XI. Ads API</h3>

<ol>
<li>Separate apps: You must use separate apps for your staging, self-service, managed service, and white-labeled apps.  If you offer a white-label version of your app, you must only do so by creating a unique app for each end-advertiser (or requiring each end-advertiser to create their own app) and you must include a required field for the third party to agree to Facebook's Platform Policies.  </li>
<li>Separate ad accounts: You must use separate ad accounts for each end-advertiser and use our multi-client manager functionality to structure your end-advertiser accounts.  You must never combine multiple end-advertisers within the same ad account, and this includes their Facebook connections (ex: pages and apps).  </li>
<li>Freemium: If you offer a free or trial version of an ads API app, you must allow no more than 50 ad creations per day per customer, require phone or email verification for all new accounts, and prohibit affiliate networks from using your technology.  </li>
<li>Pricing transparency:  You must only charge fees for the use of your tools and managed services, and must only do so on a fixed fee (per campaign or period) or variable percentage of ad spend.  You must disclose to your clients the actual amount that you spent on Facebook advertising based on the auction pricing, including the actual Facebook metrics (e.g. CPC, CPM rate) and the amount you charged as fees. We reserve the right to disclose this information to your client upon their request. We may require documentation from you to ensure your compliance with this policy.  </li>
<li>Data collection and use:<br/>
  a. You may place 1x1 pixel view tags on certain advertisements with our prior authorization.<br/>
  b. All data collected or obtained by you or the end-advertiser, including but not limited to all view tag data that is not otherwise available through the Facebook service, and all data derived therefrom, may only be used by you or the end-advertiser on an anonymous basis to optimize and measure the performance of that end-advertiser's Facebook campaign. Neither you nor the end-advertiser may use data for the following purposes: retargeting whether on or off of the Facebook service; to commingle the data across multiple campaigns; to build or augment any user profiles, or to use piggybacking or redirects with the 1x1 pixel tags, or for any other purpose not expressly authorized by us.<br/>
  c. You must not permit any person (other than an agent acting on the end-advertiser's behalf) to access the end-advertiser's Ad or Sponsored Story advertising statistics, including but not limited to, fixed CPM rates and any other raw, aggregate, or anonymous statistics derived from this data.  </li>
<li>Separate Reporting:  If you use last-click attribution, create reporting tools that separate Facebook reporting from other channels. For example, don't create reporting dashboards that directly compare Facebook Ads metrics to search or display marketing metrics on a last-click basis.  If you support other channels, you must either create a separate Facebook tool, include Facebook metrics in a separate Facebook section of your tool, or show multi-touch attribution results side-by-side with last-click attribution results. You may report Facebook mobile ads ROI metrics as they relate to other mobile ads channels.  </li>
<li>Self-service reporting for Homepage ads: You must include a self-service reporting dashboard, through which end-advertisers may access up-to-date reports (raw ad statistics) for all available data points of their Homepage Ad and Sponsored Story campaigns.<a name="custom_audiences"></a>  </li>
<li>Bidding types: You must implement all bidding types, including Optimized CPM, and you must not default to a specific type (ex: you must not default to CPC and hide oCPM).  </li>
<li>Custom Audiences:<br/>
  a. If you use custom audiences you must comply with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608171216/https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos.php">Custom Audience Terms</a>.<br/>
  b. You may create a custom audience on a client's behalf but must only use the client's customer data to do so (ex: you must not collect or provide any additional data to create a custom audience).<br/>
  c. You must not use Facebook User IDs to create custom audiences unless the person associated with the User ID has logged into your client's app and your client has secured any necessary consent from that person (ex: you must not create a custom audience based on users who have engaged with a Facebook Page).<br/>
  d. You must not sell custom audiences, and must not transfer a custom audience to anyone without our permission.<br/>
  e. Your custom audience tool may provide the same functionality and targeting options that Facebook provides, but you must not provide additional data or targeting options.  </li>
<li>Enforcement: You must immediately revoke an end-advertiser's access to your app upon our request.</li>
